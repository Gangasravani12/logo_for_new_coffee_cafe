# Design a logo and brand identity for a new coffee shop

This project, completed on the Bluelearn platform using Canva, involved designing a logo for **Bean Bliss Cafe**. The concept focused on 

a modern and elegant design featuring green text, a subtle coffee bean symbol, and the tagline **"Awaken Your Senses Here."** 

The target audience is coffee lovers seeking a relaxing and enjoyable experience. Deliverables included high-resolution PNG 

and JPEG files, a vector file, and mockups of the logo applied to different branding materials. The outcome was a memorable and 

versatile logo that successfully captured the essence of the **Bean Bliss Cafe brand.**
